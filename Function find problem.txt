	PROBLEM
Function "find" because of detailing direction of searching doesnt take into account the location of previous searching. The word inside which there is a location doesnt exist in the document - thats what function says.

	FIND_FUNCTION
1. last symbol - location in the document		last_word_up
    find: complinent
    direction: up
2. last symbol - location in the document		last_word_down
    find: complinent
    direction: down
3. first symbol - location in the document		first_character_up
    find: a
    direction: up
4. first symbol - location in the document		first_character_down
    find: a
    direction: down
    -> keep searching up to the word "hat"
5. "hat" - location in the document		FAIL	word_word_up
   find: hat
   direction: up
6. "hat" - location in the document		FAIL	word_word_down
   find: hat
   direction: down

	REPLACE_FUNCTION
1. first symbol - location in document		first_character_word
    find: "a"
    replace: "Manual"
    -> keep searching up to "hat"
         -> "hManualt"
2. first symbol - location in document	            first_notexisting_word
    find: "aaa"
    replace: "Manual"
    -> Cannot find "aaa"
3. last symbol - location in document	FAIL	last_character_word
